## Usage

To use this app you will need to install express using node.js. This app uses ajax get, post, and delete methods to post new notes onto a stored database on the server, get notes that have already been stored, and delete any notes the user wishes to remove. 

I would like to eventually include a way to allow users to create their own username/password interface so they can see/edit their personal/private notes because the current itteration only allows for one user and does not have any security attached to their notes.
